## Objectives

1. Provide a method for translating pediatric blood pressures, dependent on age,
   sex, and height (if known), to percentiles.

2. Provide functions to get the percentiles for other growth standards.

## Methodology

Blood pressure percentiles are based on Gaussian distributions defined by published
values for the mean and standard deviation, or derived mean and standard
deviations based on published percentiles.  Growth standards are based on LMS
approximations.  All the methods get parameters based on lookup tables.

## Blood Pressure
There are several data sources used to inform the blood pressure percentiles
estimates:

1. Gemelli et al. (1990)
2. Lo et al. (2013)
3. NHLBI/CDC (2011)
4. Flynn et al. (2017)

The default method is to use the workflow defined in Martin, DeWitt, et al.
(2022).

End users may opt to use any single data source.

Example: A 28 month old female with a stature of 92 cm has a recorded blood
pressure of 95/50.  Find the percentiles.

```r
library(pedbp)
p_bp(q_sbp = 95, q_dbp = 50, male = 0, age = 28, height = 92)
```

Selecting the source data is also possible

```r
p_bp(q_sbp = 95, q_dbp = 50, male = 0, age = 28, height = 92, source = "martin2022")  # Default
p_bp(q_sbp = 95, q_dbp = 50, male = 0, age = 28, height = 92, source = "gemelli1990")
p_bp(q_sbp = 95, q_dbp = 50, male = 0, age = 28, height = 92, source = "lo2013")
p_bp(q_sbp = 95, q_dbp = 50, male = 0, age = 28, height = 92, source = "nhlbi")
p_bp(q_sbp = 95, q_dbp = 50, male = 0, age = 28, height = 92, source = "flynn2017")
```

You can also find the quantile values.  Example: what is the SBP/DBP values for
the 42nd percentile of 13 year (156 month) old males in the 90th height percentile?

```r
q_bp(p_sbp = 0.42, p_dbp = 0.42, age = 156, male = 1, height_percentile = 0.90)
```

More examples can be found in the vignette.

```r
vignette("bp-distributions", package = "pedbp")
```

## Growth Standards

Growth standards based on both CDC and WHO data are provided in this package.
Read more in the vignette

```r
vignette(topic = "growth-standards", package = "pedbp")
```

Growth standards implemented in the package are:
* `bmi_for_age`
* `head_circumference_for_age`
* Stature for Age
  * `height_for_age`
  * `length_for_age`
* `weight_for_age`
* Weight for Stature
  * `weight_for_length`
  * `weight_for_height`


```r
# Example: what is the percentile for a BMI of 23 in a 14.5 year old male?
p_bmi_for_age(q = 23, male = 1, age = 14.5*12, source = "CDC")
```

```
## [1] 0.8502674
```

```r
p_bmi_for_age(q = 23, male = 1, age = 14.5*12, source = "WHO")
```

```
## [1] 0.8880632
```

## How to Install `pedbp`

Install from CRAN:


```r
install.packages("pedbp")
```

Install the developmental version:

```r
remotes::install_github("dewittpe/pedbp", dependencies = TRUE)
```

*NOTE:* If you are working on a Windows machine you will need to download and
install [`Rtools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

## Shiny Application

An interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) application is also available.
After installing the pedbp package and the suggested
packages, you can run the app locally via


```r
shiny::runApp(system.file("shinyapps", "pedbp", package = "pedbp"))
```

The shiny app is also live on [shinyapps.io](https://dewittpe.shinyapps.io/pedbp/)
