## Objective
Provided a method for translating pediatric blood pressures, dependent on age,
sex, and height (if known), to percentiles.

## Method
Blood pressure precentiles are based Gaussian distributions defined by published
values for the mean and standard deviation, or derived mean and standard
deviations based on published percentiles.

## How to Install

Install the developmental version:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("dewittpe/pedbp", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Tools

### Blood Pressure Distribution and Quantile Functions

Inputs for these functions are:

* age: in months _required_
* male: indicator for for sex; 0 = female, 1 = male, _required_
* height: in centimeters, _if known_
* sbp,dbp: blood pressure, in mmHg _if known_

```{r}
d <- read.csv(system.file("example_data", "for_batch.csv", package = "pedbp"))
d
# distribution function
p_bp(  q_sbp  = d$sbp..mmHg.
     , q_dbp  = d$dbp..mmHg.
     , age    = d$age_months
     , male   = d$male
     , height = d$height..cm.
     )

# quantile function
q_bp(  p_sbp = 0.50
     , p_dbp = 0.40
     , age   = 96
     , male  = 1)
```

You may also get plots showing where an observed blood pressure is on the
distribution curve
```{r, label = "bp_cdf_example", fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.path = "inst/images/"}
bp_cdf(  sbp = 105
       , dbp = 59
       , age   = 96
       , male  = 1)
```

More examples and details for the blood pressure distribution functions, along
with additional features such as CDC growth charts, can be found in the package
vignette.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("bp-distributions", package = "pedbp")
```

### Shiny Application
You may use an interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application as
well.  Assuming you have installed the pedbp package along with the suggested
packages then you can run the app locally via
```{r, eval = FALSE}
shiny::runApp(system.file("shinyapps", package = "pedbp"))
```
