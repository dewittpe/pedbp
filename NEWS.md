# pedbp 1.0.2

* Bug Fixes:
  - Warning when age and height is out of the range in the provided data sets
    instead of error.  This fixes (#5).  The logic is still good.  The known bug
    was when 35.5 < age < 36 for length_by_age_inf which only has age up to 35.5
    but the logic for use of that set is age < 36.  A warning will not be given
    if 35.5 < age < 36.
