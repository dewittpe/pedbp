get_height_percentile(age, male, height, ...)

\description{
Based on CDC data, height percentiles are estimated by age and sex, and by
interpolating CDC published quantiles with a Guassian distribution.
}
\details{
The \code{\link{cdc_length_for_age}} data was interploated to derive a mean
and standard deviation for a Guassian approximation of the height
percentiles.
}
\examples{

 e <- new.env()
 utils::data(list = "cdc_length_for_age", package = "pedbp", envir = e)

 e$cdc_length_for_age[130, ]
 #get_height_percentile(age = 78.5, male = 1, height = 109.0335)
 #get_height_percentile(age = 78.5, male = 1, height = 122.4042)
